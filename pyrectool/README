This Python tool makes it easy to recognize large evaluation sets with different
parameters. It's able to take care of speaker adaptation and submit the commands
to a computing cluster. Currently it works in ICSI which has a Pmake / Customs
cluster, in Aalto ICS, which has a Condor cluster, and in the Triton SLURM
cluster. It's easy to port it to any other clustering environment.

The idea is that you write a script file where you set the parameters using
environment variables. Most parameters have sane defaults. There's an example
below.

By default it writes the LNA files in

$HOME/recognitions/<am>

where <am> is the acoustic model name. This way it's able to reuse LNAs between
runs that use the same acoustic model. Lattices etc. recognition files are
written in

$HOME/recognitions/<am>/<options>

where <options> is combined from all the options that affect decoding. It
combines the recognized hypotheses into a .trn file (by default in
$HOME/results) whose name is combined from the acoustic model and all the
selected options, so the name becomes really long, e.g.

speecon_all_multicondition_mmi_kld0.002_6-FreeDictationLM.6gram-FreeDictationLM-FreeDictationLM.2gram-b280-tl100k.trn

but this way you can store all the results with unique names and compare them
later.
